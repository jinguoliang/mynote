repo COMMAND OPTIONS
repo help COMMAND

1.init
repo init -u URL [OPTIONS]
-u: specify a URL from which to retrieve a manifest repository. The common manifest can be found at https://android.googlesource.com/platform/manifest
-m: select a manifest file within the repository. If no manifest name is selected, the default is default.xml.
-b: specify a revision, i.e., a particular manifest-branch
2.sync
repo sync [PROJECT_LIST]
Downloads new changes and updates the working files in your local environment
	If the project has never been synchronized, then repo sync is equivalent to git clone. All branches in the remote repository are copied to the local project directory.
	If the project has already been synchronized once, then repo sync is equivalent to:
	git remote update 
	git rebase origin/BRANCH
	where BRANCH is the currently checked-out branch in the local project directory. If the local branch is not tracking a branch in the remote repository, then no synchronization will occur for the project.
-d: switch specified projects back to the manifest revision. Helpful if the project is currently on a topic branch, but the manifest revision is temporarily needed.
-s: sync to a known good build as specified by the manifest-server element in the current manifest.
-f: proceed with syncing other projects even if a project fails to sync.
3.status
repo status [PROJECT_LIST]
Compares __the working tree__ to __the staging area__ (index) and t__he most recent commit__ on this branch (HEAD) in each project specified. Displays a summary line for each file where there is a difference between __these three states.__

some status mark:
R	renamed	not in HEAD, path changed in index
C	copied	not in HEAD, copied from another in index
T	mode changed	same content in HEAD and index, mode changed
U	unmerged	conflict between HEAD and index; resolution required
