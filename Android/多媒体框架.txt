====== 多媒体框架 ======
Created Tuesday 28 January 2014

There is a new playback engine implemented by Google comes with Android 2.0 (i.e, Stagefright), which seems to be quite simple and straightforward compared with the OpenCORE solution.

MediaExtractor is responsible for retrieving track data and the corresponding meta data from the underlying file system or http stream;
Leveraging OMX for decoding: there are two OMX plugins currently, adapting to PV's software codec and vendor's hardware implementation respectively. And there is a local implementation of software codecs which encapsulates PV's decoder APIs directly;
AudioPlayer is responsible for rendering audio, it also provides the timebase for timing and A/V synchronization whenever audio track is present;
Depending on which codec is picked, a local or remote render will be created for video rendering; and system clock is used as the timebase for video only playback;
AwesomePlayer works as the engine to coordinate the above modules, and is finally connected into android media framework through the adapter of StagefrightPlayer.
