Runtime resource overlay

So far, the article has focused on resource overlay at compile time. Starting with commit
https://review.source.android.com/#change,19337
the Android resource lookup framework has been extended to perform the actual overlay in runtime. This is done by loading the original (unmodified) .apk together with a special overlay .apk containing only new resource values. During lookup, resources may be fetched from either .apk.
Our plan is to gradually use and extend runtime resource overlay. The above commit limits usage to overlay of the Android framework resources. Our end goal is to provide a framework for skinning of third party applications, but it is still far in the future: to achieve the goal several issues must be solved, not least security concerns.
Resource overlays is a powerful tool, which can be used to solve several problems, without the need to patch â€“ please use it.
