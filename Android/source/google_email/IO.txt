====== IO ======
Created Wednesday 29 January 2014

These classes aim to add to the standard JDK IO classes.
The utilities provide convenience__ wrappers around the JDK__, __simplifying__
various operations into pre-tested units of code.
The filters and streams provide useful implementations that perhaps should
be in the JDK itself.
