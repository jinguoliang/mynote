物理内存很快占满，且不释放
/proc/sys/vm/drop_caches (since Linux 2.6.16)  
 Writing to this file causes the kernel to drop clean caches,  
 dentries and inodes from memory, causing that memory to become  
 free.  
 To free pagecache, use echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches; to  
 free dentries and inodes, use echo 2 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches;  
 to free pagecache, dentries and inodes, use echo 3 > 
 /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches.  
 Because this is a non-destructive operation and dirty objects  
 are not freeable, the user should run sync first.
