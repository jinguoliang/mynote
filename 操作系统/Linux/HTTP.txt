=== User-Agent ===
The format of the User-Agent string in HTTP is a list of product tokens (keywords) with optional comments.
一系列的带有注释的产品关键字
__例子__
WikiBrowser, their user agent string might be WikiBrowser/1.0 Gecko/1.0. The "most important" product component is listed first. The parts of this string are as follows:

Product name and version (WikiBrowser/1.0)
Layout engine and version (Gecko/1.0). In this case, this indicates the Layout engine and version.

在第一次浏览器战争期间,一些服务器只给Mozilla的某个版本的客户端发送带有高级特性的网页.而其他浏览器则被认为是老的,落后的.
因此,大部分浏览器都这样配置User-Agent:
Mozilla/[version] ([system and browser information]) [platform] ([platform details]) [extensions].
比如,iPad上的Safari这样配置:
 Mozilla/5.0 (iPad; U; CPU OS 3_2_1 like Mac OS X; en-us) AppleWebKit/531.21.10 (KHTML, like Gecko) Mobile/7B405
各部分的含义:
	Mozilla/5.0: Previously used to indicate compatibility with the Mozilla rendering engine
	(iPad; U; CPU OS 3_2_1 like Mac OS X; en-us): Details of the system in which the browser is running
	AppleWebKit/531.21.10: The platform the browser uses
	(KHTML, like Gecko): Browser platform details
	Mobile/7B405: This is used by the browser to indicate specific enhancements that are available directly in the browser or through third parties. An example of this is Microsoft Live Meeting which registers an extension so that the Live Meeting service knows if the software is already installed, which means it can provide a streamlined experience to joining meetings.


==== Header ====

The header fields are transmitted after the request or response line, which is the first line of a message. Header fields are colon-separated name-value pairs in clear-text string format, terminated by a carriage return (CR) and line feed (LF) character sequence. The end of the header section is indicated by an empty field, resulting in the transmission of two consecutive CR-LF pairs. Historically, long lines could be folded into multiple lines; continuation lines are indicated by the presence of a space (SP) or horizontal tab (HT) as the first character on the next line. This folding is now deprecated.[1]
