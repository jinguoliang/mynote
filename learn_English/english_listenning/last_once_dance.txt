====== last once dance ======
Created Monday 14 October 2013

just last one's down before we say goodbye when we sway and turn round and round and round 
it's like the first time 
cause the night is getting cold
and I don't know where i belong
just one last dance 
the wine and the lights and the Spanish guiltar
I'll never forget how romantic they are
but I know,tomorrow I'll lose the one I love 
there's no way to come with you
it's the only thing to do
just one last dance 
before we say goodbyte 
it's like the first time 
just one more time 
hold me tight and keep me warm 
cause the night is getting cold
then i don't know where i belong 
just one last dance
oh ,baby
just one  last dance
before we say goodbye 
when we sway and turn round and round 
just one more time 
hold me tight is getting gold
befor we say good byre
hold me tight is getting cold 
just one last dance 
just one more chance
just one more chance
