====== Stronger ======
Created Tuesday 15 October 2013

you know the bed feels warmer
sleeping here alone 
you know i'm dreaming in color
and do the thing i want

think you left me broken down
Think that i come back
Baby you don't know me ,cause you're devil
what doesn't kill you makes you stronger
stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm alone when i'm alone 
what doesn't kill you makes  a fire
put that thing on ligher
Doesn't mean i'm over cause you'r gone 
what doesn't kill you makes you stronger,stronger
just me myself and i
doesn't mean i'm lonely when i'm alone
you heart that i was starting over with someone new 
but told you i was moving on onver you
You didn't think i came back
I'd come back swinging
you try to broken me what you say
what don't kill me make me stronger 
case me alone 
make you stronger stroner\
just me myself and i
think you 
what doesn't kill you makes you stronger,taller
make stand taller
donesn't mean i'm alone when im alone
