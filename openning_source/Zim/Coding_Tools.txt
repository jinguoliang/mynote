====== Coding Tools ======
Created Sunday 01 November 2015

Some usefull sctipts are found in the ''./tool/'' folder of the source archive.

When you want to setup an environment for continuous testing while working on the source code, try using ''./tools/test_file.py'' . This tool maps the source file to the test suite and runs the appropriate unittests for this file.

Of course it is good practise to run the whole suite before checking in a new feature, but running the tests per source file will definitely help with rapid development.
